        "description": "The Purity Hub Auto H-75 is a fully automatic, high-performance hybrid filtration system that intelligently combines carbon and sand filtration with a water softener to deliver comprehensive water purification. Unlike traditional setups that require two separate multiport valves, the Auto H-75 is uniquely engineered to function with a single, specially designed multiport valve that controls both the carbon and sand filters, along with the water softener—eliminating the need for dual valves. This innovation not only reduces plumbing complexity and system cost but also significantly saves water during cleaning and regeneration cycles by optimizing flow and cycle efficiency. The multiport valve is built using hard-sealing ceramic discs, fired at extreme temperatures between 1680°C to 2200°C, making it highly durable, corrosion-resistant, and maintenance-free over the long term. The system is preloaded with premium-grade sand and carbon media, along with 15% cross-linked ion exchange resin for maximum filtration and softening performance. To further enhance reliability, it includes weather-resistant wiring capable of withstanding heat, rain, and cold, and features tool-free push-fit brine connections for hassle-free installation. Advanced functionalities such as Purity Hub’s patented Low Salt Alarm, Smart Info Panel, LP-BFT (Low Pressure – Before Tank) safety mechanism, and a dual-function regeneration and pressure pump make the Auto H-75 a compact, eco-efficient, and intelligently designed solution for modern water treatment needs."

        "description": "The Purity Hub Auto H-150 is a fully automatic, high-performance hybrid filtration system that intelligently combines carbon and sand filtration with a water softener to deliver comprehensive water purification. Unlike traditional setups that require two separate multiport valves, the Auto H-150 is uniquely engineered to function with a single, specially designed multiport valve that controls both the carbon and sand filters, along with the water softener—eliminating the need for dual valves. This innovation not only reduces plumbing complexity and system cost but also significantly saves water during cleaning and regeneration cycles by optimizing flow and cycle efficiency. The multiport valve is built using hard-sealing ceramic discs, fired at extreme temperatures between 1680°C to 2200°C, making it highly durable, corrosion-resistant, and maintenance-free over the long term. The system is preloaded with premium-grade sand and carbon media, along with 15% cross-linked ion exchange resin for maximum filtration and softening performance. To further enhance reliability, it includes weather-resistant wiring capable of withstanding heat, rain, and cold, and features tool-free push-fit brine connections for hassle-free installation. Advanced functionalities such as Purity Hub’s patented Low Salt Alarm, Smart Info Panel, LP-BFT (Low Pressure – Before Tank) safety mechanism, and a dual-function regeneration and pressure pump make the Auto H-150 a compact, eco-efficient, and intelligently designed solution for modern water treatment needs."

Unlike Purity Hub Hybrid Single Valve Models, the Hybrid I-75 is designed with two dedicated multiport valves—one for the Carbon & Sand Filter and the other exclusively for the Softener. This intelligent separation is essential because carbon and sand media require frequent backwashing, especially in high-turbidity water conditions, whereas the softener’s resin regeneration is based on Output-Based Regeneration (OBR). By keeping the softener cycle isolated, the system ensures accurate resin regeneration while allowing independent and timely backwashing of the filters.\n\nBoth multiport valves are crafted with hard-sealing ceramic discs, fired at extreme temperatures between 1680°C to 2200°C, offering unmatched durability, corrosion resistance, and near-zero maintenance. Additionally, the two valves are smartly interlocked—each valve checks the operational status of the other before initiating its cleaning cycle. This intelligent interlocking system ensures that the Carbon & Sand Filter backwash or Resin Regeneration only begins when adequate water is available, preventing pressure drops and enhancing overall system efficiency.\n\nThe system comes preloaded with premium-grade sand and carbon media, along with 15% cross-linked ion exchange resin, ensuring superior filtration and softening performance. Engineered for Indian weather conditions, it includes weather-resistant wiring, tool-free push-fit brine pipe connections, Purity Hub’s patented Low Salt Alarm, a Smart Info Panel, LP-BFT (Low Pressure – Before Tank) technology, and a dual-function regeneration and pressure pump—making the Hybrid I-75 a powerful, eco-efficient, and smart water treatment solution built for long-term reliability."

        "description": "The Purity Hub Auto Z-150 is a fully automatic, intelligently engineered hybrid water softener that combines advanced softening technology with 5-micron precision filtration using special glass media—offering superior clarity and protection from fine particles. Unlike conventional setups that require two separate multiport valves, the Auto Z-150 uses a single, specially designed multiport valve to manage both filtration and softening functions, significantly reducing plumbing complexity, cost, and water wastage during regeneration. The valve is built with high-strength ceramic discs, fired at extreme temperatures (1680°C to 2200°C), ensuring long-term durability and corrosion resistance. The system comes preloaded with 15% cross-linked ion exchange resin for enhanced hardness removal and is equipped with weatherproof wiring, push-fit brine connectors for tool-free installation, and smart automation features. These include Purity Hub’s patented Low Salt Alarm, a real-time Smart Info Panel, the LP-BFT safety system to prevent dry regeneration, and a dual-function pump interface that allows the regeneration motor to double as a pressure pump. Compact, eco-efficient, and reliable, the Auto Z-150 is a next-generation solution for homes and communities seeking high-performance water purification in a single intelligent unit."
